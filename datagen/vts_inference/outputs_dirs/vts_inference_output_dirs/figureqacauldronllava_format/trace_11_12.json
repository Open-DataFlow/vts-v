                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

                    "content": "### Task Description:\n    You are tasked with answering a visual reasoning question by interacting with an image. Your goal is to select and apply the correct tools (such as grounding, segmentation, depth estimation, etc.) step by step to derive an answer. \n    You may need to use the available tools to process the images and reason through them based on their visual outputs. Your reasoning process should involve choosing the most relevant tool, executing actions, and updating your thought process based on the results of each action.\n    Your visual abilities may have limitations, so it is important to leverage the tools efficiently and reason step by step to solve the user's request.\n    \n    Please do whatever it takes to provide an answer, and do not return in the final result that you are unable to obtain an answer.\n    \n    ### Available Tools:\n    Below is a description of the tools that can be used to process and reason about the images. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    1. Dividing the image into patches\n    2. Running object detection on each patch\n    3. Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3.

Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image         \n    12. **Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    Once you have the answer, use this tool to terminate the reasoning process and provide the final answer. This action is used when all necessary reasoning steps are completed.\n\n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "
