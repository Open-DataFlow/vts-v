You can select and use available tools to assist in your response. You may need to perform operations on the image using these tools and make further judgments based on the returned results.\n    \n    At each step of reasoning, you will be instructed whether to call a tool or provide the final answer. You must strictly follow the given instruction to execute the corresponding actions.\n    - When instructed to use a Tool Action, you must select and execute exactly one of the following actions to proceed with the visual reasoning task: GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, CropAction, SegmentAction, OCRAction, OverlayAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction.\n    - When instructed to return the final answer, you must use TerminateAction to provide the conclusive response.\n\n    ### Available Actions\n    Below are the specifications for the tool actions that can be used to process and reason about the images and the TerminateAction that should be used to conclude the final answer. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    #### Tool Actions\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    - Dividing the image into patches\n    - Running object detection on each patch\n    - Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n\n\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n\n    ####**Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    - You can only generate a TerminateAction when a message explicitly instructs you to do so.\n    - Your should use this action to give the final response\n    \n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

Your task is to evaluate whether the Reasoner should continue or terminate.The reasoner performs image reasoning tasks and can utilize the following existing tools:GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, OverlayAction, TerminateAction.The actions GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, and OverlayAction indicate that the reasoner needs to perform actual operations on the image and make further reasoning based on the returned image operation results. The TerminateAction indicates that the reasoner should use this action to return the final answer to the user. Your task is to determine whether the reasoner should invoke TerminateAction in the next step to return the result to the user.\n    \n    Each time I provide input, it will follow this format:\n    1. <question></question> represents the user's question received by the reasoner.\n    2. <reasoner></reasoner> denotes the reasoner's inference.\n    3. <observation></observation> indicates the result after executing the reasoner's action.\n    4. A resulting image may follow <observation></observation>, representing the visual output produced after executing the action specified by the reasoner.\n\n    At the beginning, I will give you a system role message to indicate your function, then input the original image and the user's original question. After that, I will use <reasoner></reasoner> and <observation></observation> to provide the reasoning actions made by the reasoner and the results produced by executing the corresponding actions. I may input many rounds to you, each round being the reasoner's current-step reasoning and corresponding action execution results. You don't need to help answer the question itself. Your task is to determine, based on your capability, whether the reasoner needs to continue performing action reasoning or can use TerminateAction to return the final answer to the user based on the existing reasoning.\n\n    You need to provide a reward score between 0 and 1 to indicate whether the reasoner's current reasoning results are sufficient to give the correct answer. A score closer to 1 means the reasoner should use TerminateAction to return the correct result in the next step, while a score closer to 0 means the reasoner should continue tool invocation and reasoning.\n\n    ### Important Notes: \n    - This response strictly follows your instruction by providing only a reward score between 0-1 without any additional content. \n    - Do not answer the user's question, but rather evaluate the reasoning steps provided by the reasoner\n    \n    "

The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.

You can select and use available tools to assist in your response. You may need to perform operations on the image using these tools and make further judgments based on the returned results.\n    \n    At each step of reasoning, you will be instructed whether to call a tool or provide the final answer. You must strictly follow the given instruction to execute the corresponding actions.\n    - When instructed to use a Tool Action, you must select and execute exactly one of the following actions to proceed with the visual reasoning task: GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, CropAction, SegmentAction, OCRAction, OverlayAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction.\n    - When instructed to return the final answer, you must use TerminateAction to provide the conclusive response.\n\n    ### Available Actions\n    Below are the specifications for the tool actions that can be used to process and reason about the images and the TerminateAction that should be used to conclude the final answer. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    #### Tool Actions\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    - Dividing the image into patches\n    - Running object detection on each patch\n    - Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n\n\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n\n    ####**Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    - You can only generate a TerminateAction when a message explicitly instructs you to do so.\n    - Your should use this action to give the final response\n    \n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

Your task is to evaluate whether the Reasoner should continue or terminate.The reasoner performs image reasoning tasks and can utilize the following existing tools:GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, OverlayAction, TerminateAction.The actions GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, and OverlayAction indicate that the reasoner needs to perform actual operations on the image and make further reasoning based on the returned image operation results. The TerminateAction indicates that the reasoner should use this action to return the final answer to the user. Your task is to determine whether the reasoner should invoke TerminateAction in the next step to return the result to the user.\n    \n    Each time I provide input, it will follow this format:\n    1. <question></question> represents the user's question received by the reasoner.\n    2. <reasoner></reasoner> denotes the reasoner's inference.\n    3. <observation></observation> indicates the result after executing the reasoner's action.\n    4. A resulting image may follow <observation></observation>, representing the visual output produced after executing the action specified by the reasoner.\n\n    At the beginning, I will give you a system role message to indicate your function, then input the original image and the user's original question. After that, I will use <reasoner></reasoner> and <observation></observation> to provide the reasoning actions made by the reasoner and the results produced by executing the corresponding actions. I may input many rounds to you, each round being the reasoner's current-step reasoning and corresponding action execution results. You don't need to help answer the question itself. Your task is to determine, based on your capability, whether the reasoner needs to continue performing action reasoning or can use TerminateAction to return the final answer to the user based on the existing reasoning.\n\n    You need to provide a reward score between 0 and 1 to indicate whether the reasoner's current reasoning results are sufficient to give the correct answer. A score closer to 1 means the reasoner should use TerminateAction to return the correct result in the next step, while a score closer to 0 means the reasoner should continue tool invocation and reasoning.\n\n    ### Important Notes: \n    - This response strictly follows your instruction by providing only a reward score between 0-1 without any additional content. \n    - Do not answer the user's question, but rather evaluate the reasoning steps provided by the reasoner\n    \n    "

You can select and use available tools to assist in your response. You may need to perform operations on the image using these tools and make further judgments based on the returned results.\n    \n    At each step of reasoning, you will be instructed whether to call a tool or provide the final answer. You must strictly follow the given instruction to execute the corresponding actions.\n    - When instructed to use a Tool Action, you must select and execute exactly one of the following actions to proceed with the visual reasoning task: GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, CropAction, SegmentAction, OCRAction, OverlayAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction.\n    - When instructed to return the final answer, you must use TerminateAction to provide the conclusive response.\n\n    ### Available Actions\n    Below are the specifications for the tool actions that can be used to process and reason about the images and the TerminateAction that should be used to conclude the final answer. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    #### Tool Actions\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    - Dividing the image into patches\n    - Running object detection on each patch\n    - Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n\n\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n\n    ####**Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    - You can only generate a TerminateAction when a message explicitly instructs you to do so.\n    - Your should use this action to give the final response\n    \n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

Your task is to evaluate whether the Reasoner should continue or terminate.The reasoner performs image reasoning tasks and can utilize the following existing tools:GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, OverlayAction, TerminateAction.The actions GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, and OverlayAction indicate that the reasoner needs to perform actual operations on the image and make further reasoning based on the returned image operation results. The TerminateAction indicates that the reasoner should use this action to return the final answer to the user. Your task is to determine whether the reasoner should invoke TerminateAction in the next step to return the result to the user.\n    \n    Each time I provide input, it will follow this format:\n    1. <question></question> represents the user's question received by the reasoner.\n    2. <reasoner></reasoner> denotes the reasoner's inference.\n    3. <observation></observation> indicates the result after executing the reasoner's action.\n    4. A resulting image may follow <observation></observation>, representing the visual output produced after executing the action specified by the reasoner.\n\n    At the beginning, I will give you a system role message to indicate your function, then input the original image and the user's original question. After that, I will use <reasoner></reasoner> and <observation></observation> to provide the reasoning actions made by the reasoner and the results produced by executing the corresponding actions. I may input many rounds to you, each round being the reasoner's current-step reasoning and corresponding action execution results. You don't need to help answer the question itself. Your task is to determine, based on your capability, whether the reasoner needs to continue performing action reasoning or can use TerminateAction to return the final answer to the user based on the existing reasoning.\n\n    You need to provide a reward score between 0 and 1 to indicate whether the reasoner's current reasoning results are sufficient to give the correct answer. A score closer to 1 means the reasoner should use TerminateAction to return the correct result in the next step, while a score closer to 0 means the reasoner should continue tool invocation and reasoning.\n\n    ### Important Notes: \n    - This response strictly follows your instruction by providing only a reward score between 0-1 without any additional content. \n    - Do not answer the user's question, but rather evaluate the reasoning steps provided by the reasoner\n    \n    "

You can select and use available tools to assist in your response. You may need to perform operations on the image using these tools and make further judgments based on the returned results.\n    \n    At each step of reasoning, you will be instructed whether to call a tool or provide the final answer. You must strictly follow the given instruction to execute the corresponding actions.\n    - When instructed to use a Tool Action, you must select and execute exactly one of the following actions to proceed with the visual reasoning task: GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, CropAction, SegmentAction, OCRAction, OverlayAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction.\n    - When instructed to return the final answer, you must use TerminateAction to provide the conclusive response.\n\n    ### Available Actions\n    Below are the specifications for the tool actions that can be used to process and reason about the images and the TerminateAction that should be used to conclude the final answer. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    #### Tool Actions\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    - Dividing the image into patches\n    - Running object detection on each patch\n    - Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n\n\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1. Transparency Control (alpha): Adjust how strongly the overlay appears\n            2. Precise Positioning: Place overlays in specific regions using normalized coordinates\n            3. Multi-modal Fusion: Combine different processing results (depth, segmentation, etc.)\n        Args:\n            background_image_index (int): Index of the background image\n            overlay_image_index (int): Index of the overlay image\n            overlay_proportion (ProportionBoundingBox): Normalized coordinates {x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max} specifying:\n                - x_min: Left boundary (0=far left, 1=far right, 0<=x_min<=1)\n                - y_min: Top boundary (0=top, 1=bottom, 0<=y_min<=1)\n                - x_max: Right boundary(0<=x_min<x_max<=1)\n                - y_max: Bottom boundary(0<=y_min<y_max<=1)\n                You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY. Default covers full image ({\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":1,\"y_max\":1}),\n        Returns:\n            List[Image.Image]: Contains the composited image with overlay applied\n    9. **Text To Images Similarity Action (text_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a text query and multiple images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the most relevant image to a text description.\n        Args:\n            text (str): The reference text description\n            image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare with the text\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n    10. **Image To Text Similarity Action (image_to_texts_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between an image and multiple text descriptions using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding the best text caption for an image.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            texts (List[str]): List of text descriptions to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar text\n                - best_match_text: str of most similar text\n    11. **Image To Images Similarity Action (image_to_images_similarity_action)**\n        Calculate similarity scores between a reference image and multiple other images using CLIP model.\n        Useful for finding visually similar images.\n        Args:\n            reference_image_index (int): Index of reference image\n            other_image_indices (List[int]): List of image indices to compare\n        Returns:\n            Dict containing:\n                - similarity_scores: List[float] of similarity scores (0-1)\n                - best_match_index: int index of most similar image\n                - best_match_image: PIL.Image of most similar image\n\n    ####**Terminate Action (terminate_action)**:  \n    - You can only generate a TerminateAction when a message explicitly instructs you to do so.\n    - Your should use this action to give the final response\n    \n    ### Important Notes:\n    - **Image Index based-1**: The numbering for all your image labels should start from 1. For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

Your task is to evaluate whether the Reasoner should continue or terminate.The reasoner performs image reasoning tasks and can utilize the following existing tools:GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, OverlayAction, TerminateAction.The actions GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, and OverlayAction indicate that the reasoner needs to perform actual operations on the image and make further reasoning based on the returned image operation results. The TerminateAction indicates that the reasoner should use this action to return the final answer to the user. Your task is to determine whether the reasoner should invoke TerminateAction in the next step to return the result to the user.\n    \n    Each time I provide input, it will follow this format:\n    1. <question></question> represents the user's question received by the reasoner.\n    2. <reasoner></reasoner> denotes the reasoner's inference.\n    3. <observation></observation> indicates the result after executing the reasoner's action.\n    4. A resulting image may follow <observation></observation>, representing the visual output produced after executing the action specified by the reasoner.\n\n    At the beginning, I will give you a system role message to indicate your function, then input the original image and the user's original question. After that, I will use <reasoner></reasoner> and <observation></observation> to provide the reasoning actions made by the reasoner and the results produced by executing the corresponding actions. I may input many rounds to you, each round being the reasoner's current-step reasoning and corresponding action execution results. You don't need to help answer the question itself. Your task is to determine, based on your capability, whether the reasoner needs to continue performing action reasoning or can use TerminateAction to return the final answer to the user based on the existing reasoning.\n\n    You need to provide a reward score between 0 and 1 to indicate whether the reasoner's current reasoning results are sufficient to give the correct answer. A score closer to 1 means the reasoner should use TerminateAction to return the correct result in the next step, while a score closer to 0 means the reasoner should continue tool invocation and reasoning.\n\n    ### Important Notes: \n    - This response strictly follows your instruction by providing only a reward score between 0-1 without any additional content. \n    - Do not answer the user's question, but rather evaluate the reasoning steps provided by the reasoner\n    \n    "

You can select and use available tools to assist in your response. You may need to perform operations on the image using these tools and make further judgments based on the returned results.\n    \n    At each step of reasoning, you will be instructed whether to call a tool or provide the final answer. You must strictly follow the given instruction to execute the corresponding actions.\n    - When instructed to use a Tool Action, you must select and execute exactly one of the following actions to proceed with the visual reasoning task: GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, CropAction, SegmentAction, OCRAction, OverlayAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction.\n    - When instructed to return the final answer, you must use TerminateAction to provide the conclusive response.\n\n    ### Available Actions\n    Below are the specifications for the tool actions that can be used to process and reason about the images and the TerminateAction that should be used to conclude the final answer. Each tool has specific use cases, and you must follow those guidelines when using them.\n\n    #### Tool Actions\n\n    1. **Grounding Action (grounding_action)**:  \n    Use this tool (Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model) to locate objects in the image based on textual descriptions. It returns the image marked with segmentation masks and bounding boxes. You should use this tool when the user asks about specific objects, such as \"cat\" or \"red chair.\"  \n    **Note:** Grounding DINO can only handle simple and direct descriptions, like \"cat,\" \"man,\" \"red chair,\" etc. Avoid using complex or reasoning-based phrases like \"the object behind the person.\" If you want to detect multiple objects, you can use phrases like: \"a cat, a person\", separating them by comma.\n\n    2. **Depth Action (depth_action)**:  \n    This tool provides depth estimation, indicating the distance of objects from the camera. The depth map uses a color gradient to represent relative distances, with warmer colors indicating objects closer to the camera. Use this tool when the user asks about the spatial relationships or distances between objects.\n\n    3. **Visual Search Action (visual_search_action)**:\n    Use this tool when:\n    - The requested object is not detected in the initial search\n    - You suspect the object might be too small\n    - You need to perform a thorough search across the image\n    The tool works by:\n    - Dividing the image into patches\n    - Running object detection on each patch\n    - Returning annotated images with potential matches\n\n    4. **ZoomIn Action (zoomin_action)**:\n    ZoomInAction crops and zooms into a specific region of an image based on a provided bounding box.\n    This is particularly useful when:\n    - Objects are too small to be detected clearly\n    - You need to examine details within a specific region\n    - The initial detection results are unclear\n    The action will:\n        1. Take the specified bounding box as the region of interest\n        2. Apply default padding (5% of image dimensions) around the box\n        3. Ensure the zoomed region maintains a minimum size (at least 10% of original image)\n        4. Return the zoomed-in image while preserving aspect ratio\n    Parameters:\n        - image_index(int): The index of the image to zoom in\n        - bounding_box(BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the zoomin region\n            - x_min: int \n            - y_min: int\n            - x_max: int \n            - y_max: int\n        You MUST return parameters as a DICTIONARY.\n\n\n    5. **Crop Action(crop_action)**:\n        CropAction crops a specific region from an image based on bounding box coordinates.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to crop\n            bounding_box (BoundingBox): The bounding box coordinates defining the crop region\n            padding (float, optional): Additional padding around the bounding box. Defaults to 0.05\n        Returns:\n            The cropped image\n    6. **Segment Action (segment_action)**:\n        SegmentAction performs segmentation on an image using bounding box prompts.\n        Args:\n            image_index (int): The index of the image to segment\n            bounding_boxes (List[BoundingBox]): List of bounding boxes to use as prompts\n        Returns:\n            The original image with segmentation masks overlaid\n\n    7. **OCR Action(ocr_action)**\n        Use this tool to extract text from images, scanned documents, or PDFs. It converts visual text (printed or handwritten) into machine-readable and editable text. You should use this tool when the user provides an image containing text and asks for:\n        - Text extraction (e.g., \"What does this sign say?\")\n        - Document digitization (e.g., \"Convert this receipt into editable text.\")\n        - Data retrieval (e.g., \"Extract the email addresses from this business card.\")\n        Note:\n        - OCR works best on clear, high-contrast images with standard fonts. Handwritten or distorted text may reduce accuracy.\n        - For multi-language text, specify the language if possible (e.g., \"Extract the Chinese and English text.\").\n        - Avoid using OCR for text embedded in complex layouts (e.g., text overlaid on detailed backgrounds), as it may miss or misread characters.\n    8. **Overlay Action (overlay_action)**\n        This tool overlays two images together with controllable transparency and positioning. It is useful when you want to overlay depth maps with segmentation maps.\n        This is particularly useful for:\n            - Visualizing heatmaps/depth maps while preserving original image context\n            - Combining segmentation results with original images\n            - Highlighting specific regions with annotations\n        Key Features:\n            1.

For instance, the first image should be labeled as 1, the second as 2, and so on.\n    - **Using tools**:Please make sure to use relevant actions/tools to answer the question step-by-step, rather than directly terminating with an answer. Utilize the prepared tools in your reasoning process.\n    - **Input Complexity**: Keep grounding queries simple (\"cat\", not \"small brown cat\").\n    - **Tool Limitations**: Results are references - may contain errors.\n    - **Zooming**: Use zoomin_action when objects are small/unclear.\n    - **Visual Search**: Use visual_search_action as last resort for missing objects.\n    - **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary visual searches (computationally expensive).\n    - **Termination**: Always use terminate_action when done.\n    - When queried about image art style similarity, you may utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction module\n    - When you need to determine whether an image is a natural photograph or machine-generated, you should use DepthAction. This is because naturally captured photos exhibit more logical depth distribution with proper layering and distinct foreground-background differentiation, while most synthetic images maintain consistent depth values. Additionally, you may activate supplementary actions to assist in your analysis.\n    - When you need to determine which images represent missing portions of a given reference image, you can utilize the ImageToImageSimilarityAction. This is because fragments from the same original image will exhibit significantly higher similarity scores, which can be effectively detected using the CLIP model.\n    - When you need to evaluate the similarity between two images, you can use the ImageToImageSimilarity action. This will help you determine how similar the images are, and you can also choose to incorporate other actions as needed.\n    \n    \n\n    ### Strict Output Format\n    **Required**: You **MUST** respond **ONLY** in the following JSON format, WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation before or after:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"reasoning steps\",\n        \"action_name\": \"tool_name\", //MUST be one of: grounding_action, depth_action, zoomin_action, visual_search_action, crop_action, segment_action, ocr_action, overlay_action, text_to_images_similarity_action, image_to_texts_similarity_action, image_to_images_similarity_action, terminate_action\n        \"action\": {\n            // The parameters must exactly match one of the following types:\n            // 1. grounding_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"text\": List[str]}\n            // 2. depth_action: {\"image_index\": int}\n            // 3. zoomin_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}}\n            // 4. visual_search_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"objects\": List[str]}\n            // 5. crop_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_box\": {\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, \"padding\": float}\n            // 6. segment_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"bounding_boxes\": [{\"x_min\": int, \"y_min\": int, \"x_max\": int, \"y_max\": int}, ...]}\n            // 7. ocr_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"engine\": \"easyocr\"}\n            // 8. text_to_images_similarity_action: {\"text\": str, \"image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 9. image_to_texts_similarity_action: {\"image_index\": int, \"texts\": List[str]}\n            // 10. image_to_images_similarity_action: {\"reference_image_index\": int, \"other_image_indices\": List[int]}\n            // 11. overlay_action: {\n            //      \"background_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_image_index\": int,\n            //      \"overlay_proportion\": {\"x_min\": float, \"y_min\": float, \"x_max\": float, \"y_max\": float}\n            //    }\n            // 12. terminate_action: {\"final_response\": str}\n        }\n    }\n\n    ### Rules:\n    If you fail to follow the format, respond with:\n    {\n        \"thought\": \"ERROR: Invalid format.\",\n        \"action_name\": \"terminate_action\",\n        \"action\": {\"final_response\": \"Format error\"}\n    }\n    ```\n    For image inputs, use image_index (1-based).\n    "

Your task is to evaluate whether the Reasoner should continue or terminate.The reasoner performs image reasoning tasks and can utilize the following existing tools:GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, OverlayAction, TerminateAction.The actions GroundingAction, DepthAction, ZoomInAction, VisualSearchAction, SegmentAction, CropAction, OCRAction, TextToImagesSimilarityAction, ImageToTextsSimilarityAction, ImageToImagesSimilarityAction, and OverlayAction indicate that the reasoner needs to perform actual operations on the image and make further reasoning based on the returned image operation results. The TerminateAction indicates that the reasoner should use this action to return the final answer to the user. Your task is to determine whether the reasoner should invoke TerminateAction in the next step to return the result to the user.\n    \n    Each time I provide input, it will follow this format:\n    1. <question></question> represents the user's question received by the reasoner.\n    2. <reasoner></reasoner> denotes the reasoner's inference.\n    3. <observation></observation> indicates the result after executing the reasoner's action.\n    4. A resulting image may follow <observation></observation>, representing the visual output produced after executing the action specified by the reasoner.\n\n    At the beginning, I will give you a system role message to indicate your function, then input the original image and the user's original question. After that, I will use <reasoner></reasoner> and <observation></observation> to provide the reasoning actions made by the reasoner and the results produced by executing the corresponding actions. I may input many rounds to you, each round being the reasoner's current-step reasoning and corresponding action execution results. You don't need to help answer the question itself. Your task is to determine, based on your capability, whether the reasoner needs to continue performing action reasoning or can use TerminateAction to return the final answer to the user based on the existing reasoning.\n\n    You need to provide a reward score between 0 and 1 to indicate whether the reasoner's current reasoning results are sufficient to give the correct answer. A score closer to 1 means the reasoner should use TerminateAction to return the correct result in the next step, while a score closer to 0 means the reasoner should continue tool invocation and reasoning.\n\n    ### Important Notes: \n    - This response strictly follows your instruction by providing only a reward score between 0-1 without any additional content. \n    - Do not answer the user's question, but rather evaluate the reasoning steps provided by the reasoner\n    \n    "

The equation for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides. In this case, n=5, so the sum of the interior angles is (5-2) * 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0. I will subtract the sum of the given angles from 540\u00b0 to find m\u2220H. m\u2220H = 540\u00b0 - [(x + 20)\u00b0 + (x + 5)\u00b0 + (x - 5)\u00b0 + (x + 10)\u00b0] = 540\u00b0 - [4x + 30\u00b0] = 510\u00b0 - 4x. Since the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540\u00b0, I can set up the equation 540\u00b0 = 510\u00b0 - 4x and solve for x. 540\u00b0 = 510\u00b0 - 4x 30\u00b0 = -4x x = -7.5\u00b0. However, angles cannot be negative, so there must be an error in my calculations. Let me re-evaluate the problem.\"\n    }\n}</reasoner>"
