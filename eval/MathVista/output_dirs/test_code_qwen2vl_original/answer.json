            "question": "When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

            "gold_answer": "97",
            "full_response": "To find m\u2220H, I will use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540\u00b0. The equation for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides. In this case, n=5, so the sum of the interior angles is (5-2) * 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0. I will subtract the sum of the given angles from 540\u00b0 to find m\u2220H. m\u2220H = 540\u00b0 - [(x + 20)\u00b0 + (x + 5)\u00b0 + (x - 5)\u00b0 + (x + 10)\u00b0] = 540\u00b0 - [4x + 30\u00b0] = 510\u00b0 - 4x. Since the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540\u00b0, I can set up the equation 540\u00b0 = 510\u00b0 - 4x and solve for x. 540\u00b0 = 510\u00b0 - 4x 30\u00b0 = -4x x = -7.5\u00b0. However, angles cannot be negative, so there must be an error in my calculations. Let me re-evaluate the problem.",
